The MCP server is now running and has access to all your instruments and variables.

Claude can now:

1. **Read instrument parameters:**
   - "What's the current voltage on mock_dac1 channel 1?"
   - "Show me all parameters for mock_dac2"

2. **Inspect your workspace:**
   - "What instruments do I have available?"
   - "What variables are in my namespace?"
   - "Show me the configuration of my QCoDeS station"

3. **Monitor parameters:**
   - "Subscribe to voltage updates from mock_dac1.ch01"
   - "Monitor both DAC channels every 2 seconds"

4. **Suggest measurement code:**
   - "I want to sweep DAC1 channel 1 from 0 to 1V and measure DAC2 channel 2"
   - "Help me set up an IV measurement"

5. **Analyze data:**
   - "Look at my measurement_data array and tell me about it"
   - "What's in my config dictionary?"

Example interactions:
- Claude: "I see you have mock_dac1 and mock_dac2. Channel 1 of mock_dac1 is at 0.1V."
- Claude: "Here's code to sweep your DAC: `for v in np.linspace(0, 1, 21): mock_dac1.ch01.voltage(v)`"
- Claude: "Your measurement_data has 100 points with mean=0.05 and std=0.98"
